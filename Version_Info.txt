v0 Respo Created: DB0 Respo created, DB0 with basic demo.py & sources to test import of psycopg2

v1 Connect to DB: Just make sure you installed psql for this to work properly. Besides that it will connect to it, elkse
                    tells the user a connection issue. You can use the link below on changing the password if you would like
                     to. Or use the template @ line 22 to do a quick pass change
                Link to change pass info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-change-password/
                Quick change -> ALTER ROLE username WITH PASSWORD 'secret123';
                    Template to use on cmder -> ALTER ROLE postgres WITH PASSWORD 'secret123'';

v2 Table Creation: you can now create a db. To delete a pre-made db just type the following -> DROP TABLE table_name;
                    more link @ here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/sql-droptable.html , enjoy!


v3 User Input: user now can input the user data, e.g for school the 'admin' can enter the user's name, age, and address.

v4 Efficient Input: Learned just to use %s in replacement of inputing more work. Simplier is better for you, and for other
                        people to use/learn. Feel free to check v3 on the reason for this change to use %s.

v5 Basic Gui: using tkinter, basic info at the moment. Feel free to use Gui_Tutorial for more reference as well.
            link: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Gui_Tutorial/tree/master/tkint_tutorial_files

v6 Gui Formed: gui is formed @ user.py. aquires some resources from the tk_source.py which is located @ source, and some
                   information @ demo.py. Once the user has submitted the information, it is then added onto the DB, to see
                   the db type \d then select * from your_custom_db_name;

v7 Terminal Update: Db can now search for users using the user.py for gui interface. If a user types a # it will print
                        out the user that correlates with that ID

--v8 Updated GUI: information can be auto-seen, can now search for user's ID, and update new users/see them on the 'users'
                    list. Similiar work to https://github.com/CyborgVillager/python_final_project which has similiar props
                    Any how its great getting a refresher. Will now work w/ react for the front end side of things.

                    Objectives at hand:
                    * React mini project
                    * Grand Command
                    * A.I -> requires custom server (have some big plans!!!)
                    * Couple of py stuff
